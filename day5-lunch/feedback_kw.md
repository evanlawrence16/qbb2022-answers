The numbers of de novo mutations displayed in the plots are much higher than expected. Is it possible that the original awk's were run more than once and then the files were just appended to a lot instead of overwritten and so there's lots of duplicated data in the input files?

The R-squared values are not the size of the relationship. We're interested in the coefficient that relates the variables to one another.

I would recommend reporting p-values in the future.

The predicted number of DNM is also much higher than expected. Because the code is right, this is likely due to the input data issues
