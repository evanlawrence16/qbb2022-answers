Looks great! How did you get your answers for question 5? 

Also, not a big deal, but a tip for formatting markdown files is to enclose any blocks of code or output from the terminal in triple backticks. That will format it in a more readable way, e.g.:

```
 9514 0|0
 127 0|1
 178 1|0
 181 1|1
```
