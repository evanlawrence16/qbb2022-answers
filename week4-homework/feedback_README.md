Awesome job! This is just about perfect. Only one real issue:

1. We did want a boxplot for part 6. Your histogram does show the same data, but I would argue it's harder to see the association between the genotype and the IC50 with the overlaid histogram than the boxplot. The boxplot should be pretty easy, just check out the `plt.boxplot()` function, and let a TA or classmate know if you need help (-0.5)

One very minor thing: in your manhattan plots, I think you may be also plotting the pvals for the covariates. If you look in the output of running the linear regression, there's a `TEST` column that should help you out with that. (no points deducted).

Really really great work.
